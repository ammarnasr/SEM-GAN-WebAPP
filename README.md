# SemGAN: Text to Image Synthesis from Text Semantics using Attentional GANs

This is the code for the SemGAN model described in the paper "SemGAN: Text to Image Synthesis from Text Semantics using Attentional Generative Adversarial Networks".

## Description

SemGAN incorporates the whole sentence semantics when generating images from captions to enhance the attention mechanism outputs. This improves the overall semantic layout and visual realism of the generated images.

The model uses a multi-stage cascaded generator with multiple discriminator-generator pairs to generate images in increasing quality. A text embedding module encodes the captions, and an attentive generative module uses word-level and sentence-level attention to focus on relevant words and the overall sentence meaning when generating images. 

The model was evaluated on the CUB birds dataset.

## Usage

The main scripts are:

- `train.py` - Trains the full SemGAN model end-to-end
- `test.py` - Generates sample images given input captions  
- `eval.py` - Evaluates model performance using Inception Score and Fr√©chet Inception Distance

Key hyperparameters and model architecture choices are set in `config.py`. 

The CUB dataset should be downloaded and preprocessed first. Helpful utilities for loading and preprocessing the data are in `data_loader.py`.

Pretrained InceptionV3 weights are required to calculate the evaluation metrics. Download them from [here](https://download.pytorch.org/models/inception_v3_google-1a9a5a14.pth) and set the path in `eval.py`.
